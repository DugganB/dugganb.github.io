# About me

### Here I am!

### The quote that started me down this path, many years ago:

> “Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently.
> They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.
> About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward.
> And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.
> Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.”

**-Steve Jobs**
